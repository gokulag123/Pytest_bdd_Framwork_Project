Hi All,

This Project contains Web application Testing using Selenium with Pytest-bdd Framework. These specific usecases will help to understand a full fledged Project Framework and structure. 

For completing the Project I have created a trial Salesforce Account hence the UI look-like below and all the Xpaths, CSS locators are based on this UI. 

For using the same code please make sure the UI looks like below or update the locators respectively, Also update the username and password in (tests/conftest.py -line 14,15). 
Requirements:
Python
Selenium
Pytest-bdd
Pytest
